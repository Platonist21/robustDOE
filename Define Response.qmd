## Notations

For an assay robustness DOE:

-   Let $N$ denote total number of runs, say 24
-   Let $n$ denote total number of center runs, say 8
-   Let $K$ donate total number of samples, say 14 or 22
-   Let $T_{k,i}$ denote the observed titer or concentration of $k$th sample under $i$th condition
-   Let $i=0$ denote the center point condition
-   Let $i>0$ (positive integer) denote non-center point condition
-   Let $\mu_{k}$ denote the true titer or concentration of $k$th under center condition

## Model

$T_{k,i} = \mu_{k} + \delta_{i} + \epsilon_{k,i}$

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
