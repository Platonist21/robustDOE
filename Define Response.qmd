## Notations

For an assay robustness DOE:

-   Let $N$ denote total number of runs, say 24
-   Let $n$ denote total number of center runs, say 8
-   Let $i=0$ index the center point condition
-   Let $i=1,2,â€¦,N-n$ index the non center point conditions
-   Let $X_i$ denote the row for condition $i$ in the design matrix
-   Let $K$ donate total number of samples, say 14 or 22
-   Let $T_{i,k}$ denote the observed log titer or log concentration of $k$th sample under $i$th condition
-   Let $\mu_{k}$ denote the mean log titer or log concentration of $k$th under center condition, $\mu_k=E(T_{0,k})$

## Primary Response

For each non center point condition, $T_{i,k}-\mu_k$ is the deviation from center point. Define $Y_i=E(T_{i,k}-\mu_k)^2$ where the expectation is over all samples $k$. This $Y_i$ is on the same scale as variance on the log scale, which has a one-to-one translation to %RSD scale. We can build a model $Y \sim X$ using SVEM to predict $Y$ given condition $X$, then impose a criterion on the $Y$ surface on the %RSD scale. If the whole $Y$ surface is below the criterion, we can conclude the assay is robust within the range of the design of the experiment.

The definition of $Y_i$ involves $K$ unknown (nuisance) parameter $\mu_{k}$. The simplest estimator of $\mu_{k}$ is $m_k=\frac{1}{n} \sum T_{0,k}$, then $Y_i$ can be calculated as $\frac{1}{K} \sum{(T_{i,k}-m_k)^2}$.

## Secondary Response

If the predicted $Y$ in some part of the design space is above the acceptance criterion, the natural followup question is why. The logical place to start the investigation is to look at bias induced by conditions. Define $Z_i=E(T_{i,k}-\mu_k)$, again, where the expectation is over all samples $k$. It assumes that the bias is constant across samples at condition $i$. It can serve as the secondary response variable useful for investigation.

Plugging in $m_k$, we can calculate $Z_i$ as $\frac{1}{K} \sum{(T_{i,k}-m_k)}$.

## At Center Point

By definition, $Z_0=0$ and $Y_0$ is just pooled measurement variability (precision).

## Better Way

There is a relationship between $Y_i$ and $Z_i$: $Y_i=Z_i^2+Var(T_{i,k})$
